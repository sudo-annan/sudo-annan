## 🚀 About Me

**MSc Cyber Security graduate** from the University of York with **3+ years of professional experience** building secure, scalable cloud infrastructure and defending production systems.

I bridge the gap between **security operations and software engineering** — designing systems that are both performant and defensible. My work spans **threat detection**, **cloud security architecture**, **DevSecOps automation**, and **full-stack development** for enterprise SaaS platforms.

**What drives me:**  
Building systems where security isn't an afterthought — it's the foundation.

## 🛡️ Security Engineering

### **Red Team & Offensive Security**
- Built enterprise **Red vs Blue Team simulation labs** with Active Directory, pfSense, and multi-tier networks
- Conducted **penetration testing and vulnerability assessments** using Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nmap, and Metasploit
- Mapped attack techniques to **MITRE ATT&CK framework** for realistic threat emulation
- Exploited web applications (WordPress CVEs, privilege escalation, lateral movement)

### **Blue Team & Detection Engineering**
- Deployed centralized **SIEM** using **Wazuh**, **AlienVault OTX**, and **Sysmon** for endpoint telemetry
- Performed **forensic analysis** with Redline, Volatility, and Wireshark for IOC identification
- Built **detection rules and alert correlation** logic, improving threat visibility by **40%+**
- Implemented **Fail2Ban** and automated IP blocking for real-time threat mitigation

### **Compliance & Governance**
- Led **SOC 2**, **ISO 27001**, and **GDPR compliance** initiatives for production systems
- Implemented secure SDLC practices including threat modeling, code scanning, and access controls
- Conducted internal security audits and documented remediation plans for critical vulnerabilities

## ☁️ Cloud & DevOps Engineering

### **AWS Infrastructure & Serverless**
- Migrated legacy EC2/S3 infrastructure to **serverless architecture** (Lambda, Cognito, Fargate, Route 53)
- Reduced cloud costs by **38%** while improving scalability and fault tolerance
- Designed secure, multi-tenant SaaS platforms with **IAM policies**, **VPC segmentation**, and **encryption at rest/transit**

### **CI/CD & Automation**
- Built and maintained **CI/CD pipelines** using **Azure DevOps**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Docker**
- Automated deployments with **Kubernetes (EKS)** for GPU-intensive FastAPI workloads
- Implemented **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** practices for reproducible, auditable deployments

### **Full-Stack Development**
- Architected and deployed production **SaaS applications** using 
  - Frameworks : **React+Redux**, **Ruby on Rails**, **Django**, **Express.js** & **FastAPI**.
  - Databases  : **MySQL**, **MongoDB** and **PostgreSQL**.
  - Cloud : **Docker & Kubernetes**, **AWS**, **Azure DevOps** and **GCP**.
- Implemented **OAuth 2.0**, **JWT authentication**, and secure session management
- Integrated payment gateways (Stripe) and third-party APIs with security-first design

## 🔬 Featured Project: Enterprise Cyber Attack Simulation Lab

**MSc Dissertation — University of York (Merit, Highest Performing Student Award)**

Designed and implemented a production-style **Red vs Blue Team lab** to evaluate defensive effectiveness across progressively hardened SME networks.

**Architecture:**
- **Tier 1:** Minimal security baseline (RDP brute-force, Mimikatz credential dumping)
- **Tier 2:** Basic SME network (Active Directory, WordPress exploitation, lateral movement)
- **Tier 3:** Enhanced monitoring (Wazuh SIEM, Fail2Ban, centralized logging)

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ Built multi-tier lab with **Windows Server AD**, **pfSense firewall**, and Linux web servers
- ✅ Executed full **attack lifecycle**: reconnaissance, initial access, privilege escalation, persistence
- ✅ Mapped offensive TTPs to **MITRE ATT&CK** for structured adversary modeling
- ✅ Deployed **Wazuh SIEM** with custom detection rules achieving **40%+ detection improvement**
- ✅ Conducted **forensic analysis** using Redline, Volatility, and Wireshark for post-incident triage
- ✅ Proposed cost-effective security framework suitable for resource-constrained environments

**Tech Stack:** Kali Linux • Wazuh • Sysmon • Active Directory • pfSense • Metasploit • Wireshark • Redline

## ♟️ Beyond Code

When I'm not building secure systems or hunting threats, you'll find me:

- ♟️ Playing chess (strategy is strategy, whether on a board or in a network)
- 📚 Reading about offensive security, cloud architecture, and OSINT techniques
- 🏃 Running and hiking (debugging life, one step at a time)
- 🧩 Experimenting with automation scripts and homelab security projects
